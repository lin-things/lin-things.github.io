Hello! I am broadly interested in the following questions:

**Change**: How do people respond to dramatic natural and social changes as individuals and a society?

**Knowing, socially**: How do people help each other decide what is worthy to know? How do people help each other learn? 

I am always happy to chat about ideas. Shoot me an email!
